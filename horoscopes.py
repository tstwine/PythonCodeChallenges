               Sagittarius you have an optimistic view of life and are probably one of the most striking star
               signs of the zodiac given your unstoppable drive and positive zest for life. Being the ninth sign of
               the zodiac and ruled by jovial Jupiter, your good nature and wonderful sense of humour wins you friends
               wherever you go. You exude self-confidence and in fact are sometimes probably a little overconfident,
               but strangely you still endear others to you with your infectious laugh and generous manners.
               Jupiter is responsible for your luck but you do have a tendency to believe nothing will go wrong,
               and for this reason you’re known as being a bit of a risk taker as well. Friends and family members
               may be frightened by this attitude but they secretly envy you for having such a strong belief in yourself.
               You’re a big thinker in everything you do and can’t handle the response ‘Oh, you can’t do that’, or
               ‘That’ll never work out’. You must surround yourself with people who believe that they can achieve
               things and mutually you’ll be able to help each other achieve those farsighted goals.""",

               a little bit more with you. In fact, they are eager to let you know more about who they are.

               they are possible -- so long as you persevere and don't opt out (emotionally) too early on. On the
               other hand, keep your emotions in check and as separate as possible from tasks at hand. Friday and

               notice and be amazed. Either way, change is unavoidable. The 5th and 6th are great days to bond with
